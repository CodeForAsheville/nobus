# nobus

A simple system that allows Asheville residents to record when a bus does not arrive on time. 

This system is SMS-based, using Twilio for conversational communication with the user. Data is then recorded in a SQL database. If you need database access, please contact Patrick Conant on Slack or via email(patrick@prcapps.com).
